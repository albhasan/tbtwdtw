Apply TWDTW to time-series on the fly

This demo Web application classifies a time series using the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping algorithm.

It takes a point position as a URL parameter, then uses this point to query the Web Time Series Service to retrieve a MODIS NDVI time series, and finally, it classifies the time series. As a result, it displays the graph of the time sereis and the classifcation results.

This application is deployed using a Shiny Server. Shiny enables R applications to the Web
